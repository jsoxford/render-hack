My hacks tend to be pretty light on the front end, but I can help you connect your hacks to data.

It takes over 3 hours to figure out the National Rail SOAP API, so I made [a much simpler REST one](https://dpope.uk/renderhack) for you to use instead.

I've also played with some of Microsoft's Cognitive Services and the HTML5 Gamepad API, so I should be able to help with those.
